# Portfolio
I am a Data Scientist with experience in building insights through experimentation, product analytics and growth strategy. Currently, I am researching agent AI at UC Berkeley. Graduating in May 2025!

## [Airbnb Price Prediction](https://github.com/kkaitch/airbnb_price_prediction]
This project analyzes and predicts the prices of Airbnb in New York City. The goal is to uncover patterns that inform pricing decisions for Airbnb stakeholders - hosts, guests, and the platform. We learned that locations, room types, and neighborhood safety influence the pricing in New York.

## Machine Learning Projects
### Progresa Evaluation[https://github.com/kkaitch/progresa_evaluation]
This project is to implement some of the econometric techniques to measure the impact of Progresa on secondary school enrollment rates. The program had a causal and statistically significant impact on increasing school enrollment among poor children in Mexico. But it had no measurable impact on non-poor households

### [Linear Regression](https://github.com/kkaitch/machine_learning_linear_regression)
This project is to apply linear regression, gradient descent and regularization to tackle the California median house value. The linear regression model identified median income (MedInc) as the most influential variable in predicting median house value. The coefficient was large and positive, indicating that higher income areas are strongly associated with higher housing prices.

### [kNN](https://github.com/kkaitch/machine_learning_knn)
This project is to apply k-nearest neighbors and cross-validation to tackle the California median house value. k-NN model better captured complex, non-linear patterns in housing prices, especially in high-value areas. This highlights the flexibility of k-NN in modeling real estate data.

### [Neural Networks](https://github.com/kkaitch/machine_learning_neural_networks)
This project is to train neural network models for image classification. The trained neural network model achieved strong classification performance on the vehicle dataset, indicating that neural networks are well-suited for distinguishing between different vehicle types based on the input features.

### [Clustering](https://github.com/kkaitch/machine_learning_clustering)
This project is to play with unsupervised machine learning, using k-menas clustering to explore the basics of a face recognition system. The algorithm was able to cluster facial images into groups that shared visual patterns, showing that K-Means can detect meaningful structure in high-dimensional image data without supervision.
